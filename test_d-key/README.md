This is used as an example in the book [D3 Tips and Tricks v6](https://leanpub.com/d3-t-and-t-v6). The stock data was sourced from Mike Bostock's [small multiples example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1157787).

It is the third graph in a series that is building a multi-line graph that incorperates an automatically developed legend and a system that can toggle the lines off and on as desired.

This version is demonstrating the addition of a legend to the graph.

The graph should be taken in context with the text of the [book](https://leanpub.com/d3-t-and-t-v6) which can be downloaded for free from Leanpub.
